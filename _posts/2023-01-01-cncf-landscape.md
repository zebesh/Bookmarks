# CNCF Cloud Native Interactive Landscape

## What is the cloud native landscape?
The goal of the cloud native landscape is to compile and organize all cloud native open source projects and proprietary products into categories, providing an overview of the current ecosystem. Organizations that have a cloud native project or product can submit a PR to request it to be added to the landscape.
